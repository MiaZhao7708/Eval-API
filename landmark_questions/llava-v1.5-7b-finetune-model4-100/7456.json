Each conversation example consists of one question posed by a user, five responses provided by an AI assistant and an unique question_id which belong to the question, all in English. The question_id is used to uniquely identify and reference each question. The 'known' category implies that at least one of the AI assistant's five responses must explicitly mention the specific name of the landmark shown in the picture, similar to the standard answer. The 'unknown' category means that all of the AI assistant's responses fail to mention the specific name of the landmark and only provide generic descriptions or incorrect names.\n\n## Example 1:\n[user:]\nWhat is shown in the picture?\nPlease answer the question.\n\n[Assistant:]\n[{The picture shows a church with a clock tower and a statue of a man in front of it.},\n{The picture shows a church with a clock tower and a statue of a man in front of it.},\n{The picture shows a church with a clock tower and a statue in front of it.},\n{The picture shows a church with a clock tower and a statue of a person on the front.},\n{The picture shows a church in a city.}]\n\n[Standard Answers]\nCatedral_Metropolitana_N\n\n[Question ID]\n8247\n\n[Model:]\n{'reason': \"All the responses of the AI assistant fail to mention the specific name 'Catedral Metropolitana N' of the landmark shown in the picture.
